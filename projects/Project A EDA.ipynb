    "  \n",
    "The first thing I notice is that this data has a lot of information; the raw dataset has a total of 680 variables, which is very hard to keep track of. The data dictionary has less variables accounted for; in the raw data set, there are 6 more variables than the data dictionary. There are also many observations (33269), thus making it hard to look at everything at once. There are 8496 unique companies, so each company has more than one observation, which makes sense since the data contain quarterly measures. With the partitioning of the data for 2017 into quarters, there is an increase in the number of observations per quarter. For instance, for the quarter 1 partition, there are 4324 observations, whereas the quarter 4 partition has 4434 observations. Consolidating the quarterly data significantly decreased the number of observations in our ideal data set to 4434, compared to the original 33269 observations in the 2017 data set. For the next year data (2018), the original data set size also significantly decreased from 35728 observations to 5968 observations after filtering and consolidating the data as we did for the 2017 data set. Furthermore, the 2018 data set has the same number of variables as the 2017 data set. For both data sets, we are only keeping information that have a non-null prccq value and that have data on quarter 4. After merging the two consolidated data sets for 2017 and 2018, we are left with only 4305 observations and 2714 variables (columns). This happens because we are keeping only observations that have both 2017 and 2018 information, and the number of variables significantly increases because we are merging all columns from both data sets."

    "**ANSWER:**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Based on the numerous statistics we have calculated and the visualizations we have created, it is clear that many companies experience little to no growth. Actually, a good majority experienced losses rather than growth (roughly 75%). In fact, the mean growth is -0.12. It is also evident that the price at next year (2018) at quarter 4 has a strong correlation with the quarter 4 price of this year (2017). However, growth and the quarter 4 price in 2017 have a low correlation, meaning there is no strong linear relationship between the two variables. In general, there are a lot of missing values, especially as the number of variables increase. This is not surprising since there are very many variables to keep track of. However, we see the opposite trend with variance. With a small amount of variables, there is much greater variance. However, as there are more variables added to the table, we see variance signficantly decrease. In my line plot of the top 3 companies that experienced the greatest overall growth, it was interesting to find that over time, their price significantly decreased, yet these companies still experienced a high amount of growth in comparison to other companies. The histogram plot shows a bell shape, which means that most of the data is centered around the mean, which again supports the idea that the overall trend is that most companies did not experience growth. Finally, the scatter plot between revenue and growth also shows no strong linear relationship, which is expected since price and growth also have a low correlation."
